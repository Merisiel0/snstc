Architecture:

GPUManager:
- init connection
  - instance
  - debug messenger
  - physical device
  - device
  - fetch all queues that support bits graphics, compute and transfer
- close connection

- keeps track of which queues are free
- when command function is called:
  - submits it with everything it can when first queue of bit is free

ResourceManager:
- allocated resources on gpu ram
- allocateResources(std::vector<byte> resources, std::vector<uint32_t> offsets)
  - allocates resources in buffer
  - returns buffer
  - if new buffer, then offsets unchanged
  - if used existing buffer, offsets changed
